# Yalu Island
A modified version of kpwn's Yalu, which I hope to help complete.

This could be a complete untethered iOS 8.4.1 jailbreak (if not too challenging :/)

Credits for most of the development go to Luca Todesco / @qwertyoruiop.

Do NOT rely on me to do most of the work, I have school too.

## Current Version

0.5 beta (nothing changed yet...)

## To-do
- [ ] **Analyze code to get a better idea for what to expect/do later on**
  - [x] Untether64 process
  - [ ] Code injection scripts (stage0.sh and stage1.sh)
  - [ ] dyld/magic process scripts and dylib dynamic libraries

- [ ] Neuter AMFI device support
- [ ] Get the jailbreak's ROP working on 64-bit devices (arm64)
- [ ] Make Cydia or another process run untethered
- [ ] Make a easy-to-use jailbreak tool
